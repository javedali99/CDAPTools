**Tools for downloading and processing climatic data for analyzing multi-hazards risk and compound weather and climate extreme events.**

`CDAPTools` is a collection of functions that allows you to download atmospheric data from different sources, extract data from a NetCDF file for a particular region, process the data for further analysis, visualizing the data and apply two different methodologies we developed for analyzing multi-hazard risks and estimating compound effects of different weather and climate extreme events.
